<h3>Mu factorial proofs</h3>

<p><a href="/miscellaneous/googology/proofs/theorem-mu-0">The mu factorial has the same growth rate as the mixed factorial.</a></p>
<p><a href="/miscellaneous/googology/proofs/theorem-mu-1">The mu factorial has the same growth rate as the Ackermann function.</a></p>
<p><a href="/miscellaneous/googology/proofs/theorem-mu-2">The mu factorial has the same growth rate as &nbsp;<i>f</i><sub>𝜔</sub> in the Wainer hierarchy.</a></p>

<h3>Fast-growing hierarchy proofs</h3>

<p><a href="/miscellaneous/googology/proofs/theorem-omega-0">Lower bound on the Wainer hierarchy up to 𝜔</a></p>
<p><a href="/miscellaneous/googology/proofs/theorem-omega-1">Upper bound on the Wainer hierarchy up to 𝜔</a></p>

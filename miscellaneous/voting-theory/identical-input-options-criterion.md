The identical input options criterion requires that all voters have the same set of options for casting their ballot. If there exists some voter who can cast a vote that another voter cannot cast, then this criterion is not met.

The [anonymity criterion](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Neutrality_criterion) implies the identical input options criterion.

The identical input options criterion requires that all voters have the same set of options for casting their ballot. If there exists some voter who can cast a vote that another voter cannot cast, then this criterion is not met.

More formally, a voting method $$m$$ passes the identical input options criterion if there exists some set of legal ballots $$B$$ such that a list of ballots $$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$$ is in the domain of $$m$$ if and only if $$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n \in B$$.

The identical input options criterion is implied by the [anonymity criterion](/miscellaneous/voting-theory/anonymity-criterion) and by the [cancellation criterion](/miscellaneous/voting-theory/cancellation-criterion).

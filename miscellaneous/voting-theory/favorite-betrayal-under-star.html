<h2 id="favorite-betrayal-under-star">Favorite betrayal under STAR</h2>

<p>STAR voting is known to fail the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_electoral_systems#Strategy_criteria">favorite betrayal criterion</a>, but there is disagreement regarding which situations incentivize favorite betrayal. In <a href="https://www.starvoting.us/farewell_to_pass_fail">A Farewell to Pass/Fail:
Why We Ditched Later No Harm</a>, Emily Dempsey says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifically, STAR Voting only incentivizes Favorite Betrayal when there is a Condorcet Cycle.  Not much is known about how likely Condorcet Cycles are in real-world elections, but they are certainly less likely (and, I would wager, much more difficult for a voter to predict) than other problematic phenomena such as Vote Splitting and Center Squeeze Scenarios, in which many other voting systems incentivize Favorite Betrayal and STAR Voting does not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_electoral_systems#cite_note-starFB-33">states the following</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In STAR voting, in order for favorite betrayal to be strategically advantageous, four separate things must be true: the favorite candidate X must be in the runoff under an honest vote, X must lose the runoff under an honest vote, the betrayal beneficiary Y must not be in the runoff under an honest vote, and the Y must win the runoff under a strategic vote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is fairly straightforward to show that all four of these criteria are indeed necessary:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Assume that X is not in the runoff under an honest vote. Then decreasing the rating given to X will also result in X not making the runoff. This means that decreasing the rating given to X cannot affect the outcome of the election. However, favorite betrayal requires that decreasing the rating given to X have an effect on the outcome of the election, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, X must be in the runoff under an honest vote.</li>
  <li>Assume that X wins the runoff under an honest vote. Then the voterâ€™s most preferred outcome has occurred, so there is no incentive to cast a strategic vote instead of an honest vote. However, favorite betrayal involves casting a strategic vote, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, X must lose the runoff under an honest vote.</li>
  <li>Assume that Y is in the runoff under an honest vote. By (1.) X must be the other candidate in the runoff, and by (2.) X must lose the runoff. This means that Y must win the runoff under an honest vote, so there is no incentive to cast a strategic vote to help Y win. However, favorite betrayal involves casting a strategic vote to help Y win, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, Y must not be in the runoff under an honest vote.</li>
  <li>Assume that there is no strategic vote that causes Y to win the runoff. Since there is no incentive to attempt the impossible, there is no incentive to cast a strategic vote to help Y win the runoff. However, favorite betrayal involves casting a strategic vote to help Y win, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, Y must win the runoff under some strategic vote.</li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, it is possible to devise a counterexample to the claim that a Condorcet cycle is necessary:</p>

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Number of Voters</th>
        <th>Candidate A</th>
        <th>Candidate B</th>
        <th>Candidate C</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>In this election, Candidate A receives 36 points, Candidate B receives 31 points, and Candidate C receives 36 points, so A and C are the finalists. A is favored over C on 2 ballots while C is favored over A on 8 ballots, so C is the winner. However, the voter in the first row can change this outcome by betraying their favorite candidate:</p>

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Number of Voters</th>
        <th>Candidate A</th>
        <th>Candidate B</th>
        <th>Candidate C</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>5</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>4</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now Candidate A receives 32 points, Candidate B receives 35 points, and Candidate C receives 36 points, so B and C are the finalists. B is favored over C on 7 ballots while C is favored over B on 3 ballots, so B wins the election. Notice that this voter cannot achieve this result by simply rating A and B the same; A will still have more points than B, preventing B from reaching the runoff.</p>

<p>Importantly, this example lacks a Condorcet cycle. Instead, B is the Condorcet winner, and will always win in the runoff. Thus, this disproves the claim that favorite betrayal is only incentivized under STAR voting when a Condorcet cycle exists.</p>

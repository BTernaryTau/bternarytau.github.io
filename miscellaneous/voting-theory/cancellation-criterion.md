The cancellation criterion, also known as the [equality criterion](https://www.equal.vote/theequalvote) and as Frohnmayer balance, requires that every vote be perfectly cancelled out by some other vote. More formally, for every option for casting a ballot, there must exist an option for casting a ballot such that adding both ballots to any election will not change the result.

The cancellation criterion implies the [anonymity criterion](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Neutrality_criterion).
